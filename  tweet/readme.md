# HTML & CSS | Tweet clone

## Introduction

We have learned a lot of new stuff about HTML and CSS. Now, we will work with an small example to practice all what we learned. We are going to clone a tweet.

Jack Dorsey created [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) in 2006. Once it was ready to launch, he created his twitter account and published the following:

"just setting up my twttr"

It was March, 21st. **We will clone this first tweet from Jack's account to learn HTML and CSS :)**
